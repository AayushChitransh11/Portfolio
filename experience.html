    <p>VROOM (Virtual Reality Ontology Object Manipulation)
        Studied datasets (task metrics, pre/post-tests, social presence surveys) to understand how users navigate biomedical
        ontologies in VR.
        Deliverables-Organized and categorized raw data, creating 3D visualizations to evaluate user performance, col-
        laboration, and system interaction.
        Also analyzed survey feedback to pinpoint inconsistencies and usability issues, providing recommendations to the
        capstone team for system refinement.
        ForensicXR (Forensic Science Project)
        Analyzed participant feedback from forensic simulations, focusing on physical comfort, tool usability, and task
        completion.
        Deliverables: Cleaned and organized raw data to identify user interaction patterns, leveraging Oracle SQL and
        for data insights.
        Created visualizations highlighting trends in realism, challenge, and tutorial quality to guide future improvements.
        Drafting a research paper detailing how virtual simulations enhance forensic training, which will be a manuscript.</p>
